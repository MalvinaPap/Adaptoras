# Adaptoras Web Application

### About
Adaptoras is an online platform designed for university students studying far from their home city. At the moment it is written in greek so, as a result, is aimed at Greek students. Through this platform they can meet people in their new city that are willing to provide them with a meal, a washing machine, some sightseeing or even a short period hosting. 

This project has been completed as a semester assignment during the course "Information Systems Implementation and Architecture" thoughout the 5th semester of our studies in Athens University of Economics and Business, Department of Management Science and Technology.

###### note: the link will be active till next year, after that we will have to find another hosting solution

### Technical Characteristics
 This project follows the 3-Tier architecture logic for building webpages. For the front tier (user interface) it uses HTML and CSS (Bootstrap framework), for the application level it uses Java,JSP and JavaScript and for the database level it uses MySQL.

It is hosted on our university's web server and uses a MySQL database given to us by our professors.

### Contribution
Anyone should feel welcome to contribute, with new features or improvements. What we have not managed yet is to make it possible for our users to upload photos on the site. This would be therefore a really important contribution.
